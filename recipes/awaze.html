    <h2>Description:-</h2>

    <p>Awaze TIbs is one of the most popular and delecious Ethiopian food.
       It can be eaten for lunch and dinner.
    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients:-</h1>
    <ul>
        
        <li>1/8 cup peanut oil</li>
        <li>2 red onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and grated (about 1 1/2 tsp)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tsp berberé</li>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>1.2 lbs cubed lamb</li>
    </ul>


   <h2>Steps:-</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Chop the onions  and cook them until golden (10–15 min) over medium high, or until you can no longer stand how good the house smells. </li>
        <li>Take your time getting them nice and golden — that’s where all the flavor is.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grate the ginger. Grating is the best way to get rid of those tough fibers and helps the ginger to “disappear” into the dish.</li> 
        <li>Add the ginger and crushed garlic to the pan and cook a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Toss in the berberé. Two teaspoons made me sweat… in a good way. Much more and I might have passed out.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and brown it.</li>
        <li>Cover with beef stock and simmer partially covered for about 35 minutes, or until the lamb is tender.</li> 
        <li>If you’d like a less soupy texture simmer uncovered. Don’t forget to season it with plenty of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve with a dollop of plain yogurt, to cool the mouth after each bite.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with injera to friends.</li>
   </ol>
