    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quanta Firfir is a variation of the popular Firfir family that can be eaten for lunch, dinner, or even breakfast. 
        But what makes Quanta Firfir truly unique is the Quanta, which is dried meat similar to beef jerky.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:-</h2>

    <ul>
       <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> injera</li>
       <li>14 oz dried beef</li>
       <li>⅓ cup of vegetable oil</li>
       <li>4 ripe chopped tomatoes</li>
       <li>2 chopped red onions</li>
       <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
       <li>½ cup niter kibbeh</li>
       <li>2 tbsp berbere</li>
       <li>2 tsp salt</li>
       <li>3 cups water</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:-</h2>

    <ol>
        
       <li>Begin by cooking the onions in a large-sized saucepan at medium-high heat; until the onions start to turn brown for approx. 5 min – with the lid covered.</li>
       <li>Then add the garlic and vegetable oil and continue cooking for around 5 more minutes until you get a fragrant smell.</li>
       <li>Add the tomatoes while stirring and continue cooking for around 6 minutes until they get soft.</li>
       <li>Next, add half a cup of water and the dried beef, along with some berbere. Then lower the heat to medium and continue cooking for around 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>After that, continue to cook adding a third of a cup every now and then for around 20 minutes until the sauce thickens, and the dried beef softens.</li>
       <li>Then add the nitter kibbeh and some salt and stir the mix.</li>
       <li>Finally, take 1 injera and shred it into smaller pieces and add them to the sauce. Then mix the Quantata Firfir thoroughly but very gently until the injera soaks in the sauce properly.</li>
